Explanation of decreasing cumulative death counts for USA on 4 May.
Situation report from [[https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200504-covid-19-sitrep-105.pdf?sfvrsn=4cdda8af_2][4 May]] says

#+BEGIN_SRC 
Due to the recent trend of countries conducting data reconciliation
exercises which remove large numbers of cases or deaths from their
total counts, WHO will now display such data as negativenumbers in the
“new cases” / “new deaths” columns as appropriate. This will aid
readers in identifying when such reconciliation exercises have taken
place. When additional details become available in future which allow
the subtractions to be apportioned to previous days, numbers will be
updated accordingly. Prior situation reports will not be
retrospectively updated; the most up-to-date data can always be found
at covid19.who.int
...
United States of America data retro-adjusted by national authorities.
#+END_SRC

Applied correction by taking cummin from most recent to earliest data,
in order to get cumulative death curves that are always increasing,
and new death counts per day which are non-negative.

Why are the WHO numbers only about 50k for USA but the radio/google
says 60k? Maybe another data set is used?

[[file:wikipedia-population-analyze.R]] makes plots of deaths per million
population in each country, which makes it apparent that the death
RATE is actually larger in France than in USA (even though the total
number of deaths in USA is larger).
